## Building and Running the Project
These libraries are automatically acquired once pubget is ran. Upon getting these dependencies and setting the destination to the Dart and Flutter SDK within Android Studio, the project can be built by either setting up an emulator or connecting a device and running with a run configuration that uses main.dart as the entry point of the application.
